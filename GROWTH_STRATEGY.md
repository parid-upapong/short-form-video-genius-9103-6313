# Growth Hack Strategy: Viral Loops & Creator Incentives

## 1. The "Invisible Watermark" Loop
Every video exported by a free user contains a subtle QR code or short-link in the final frame. 
- **Conversion Hook:** "Want to make a video like this in 60 seconds? Scan here."

## 2. Referral "Power-Up" Program
Instead of cash, we reward users with **Compute Credits**.
- **The Hook:** "Invite a friend, get 5 High-Definition AI Renders."
- **Tiered Rewards:**
    - 1 Invite: Remove watermark for 1 video.
    - 5 Invites: Access to Premium AI Voices.
    - 10 Invites: "Pro" badge and early access to new templates.

## 3. The "Template Sharing" Viral Mechanism
Allow creators to share their "Prompt + Style" as a public template.
- When someone uses a shared template, the original creator gets "Influence Points" which convert to subscription discounts.

## 4. Influencer "Faceless" Challenge
Partner with 10 niche influencers (Finance, Fitness, Tech) to start "Faceless AI Channels" using OVERLORD. Document the 30-day growth results as a case study for the landing page.
