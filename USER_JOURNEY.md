# User Journey: The "Frictionless" Path

## Phase 1: The Spark (0-15 Seconds)
1.  **Landing:** User arrives at the dashboard. A large, central text box asks: "What is your video about today?"
2.  **Input:** User types: "Why drinking coffee at 3 AM is a bad idea" or pastes a blog link.
3.  **Magic Button:** User clicks "Generate Video."

## Phase 2: The Blueprint (15-45 Seconds)
1.  **Script Preview:** The AI presents a 3-act script. 
    *   *Micro-interaction:* User can click any sentence to edit it instantly.
2.  **Voice Selection:** User hears a 2-second sample of the assigned AI voice. They can toggle between "Male/Deep" or "Female/Energetic."
3.  **Visual Storyboard:** A grid of thumbnails appears showing the stock footage or AI images chosen for each segment.

## Phase 3: The Refinement (Optional, 45-70 Seconds)
1.  **Swap & Drag:** If a user dislikes a clip, they click "Swap" to see 3 AI-suggested alternatives.
2.  **Style Presets:** User selects a visual theme (e.g., "Alex Hormozi Style captions," "Minimalist," or "Neon Glow").

## Phase 4: The Finalization (70-120 Seconds)
1.  **Render:** User hits "Export." A progress bar with "Pro-tips" or "Viral Hooks" keeps them engaged.
2.  **Delivery:** Video is ready. 
    *   **Direct Post:** Buttons to "Send to TikTok" or "Post to Instagram."
    *   **Download:** Direct download to camera roll/desktop.

## Phase 5: Feedback Loop
1.  **Post-Export:** System asks: "How did we do?" 
2.  **Learning:** AI remembers the user's preferred voice and caption style for the next session.
